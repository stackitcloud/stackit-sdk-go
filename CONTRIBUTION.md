## Developer Guide

#### Useful Make commands

These commands can be executed from the project root:

- `make project-tools`: get the required dependencies
- `make lint`: lint the code and the examples and sync dependencies. To only lint automatically generated files, run `make lint skip-non-generated-files=true`
- `make test`: run unit tests. To only test automatically generated files, run `make lint skip-non-generated-files=true`

### Repository structure

The STACKIT Go SDK service modules are located under `services`. The files located in `services/[service]` are automatically generated from the [REST API specs](https://github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-api-specifications), whereas the ones located in subfolders (like `wait`) are manually maintained. Therefore, changes to files located in `services/[service]` will not be accepted. Instead, consider proposing changes to the generation process in the [Generator repository](https://github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-sdk-generator).

Inside `core` you can find several packages that are used by all service modules, such as `auth`, `config` and `wait`. Examples of usage of the SDK are located under the `examples` folder.

### Implementing a module waiter

For integration with other tools such as the [STACKIT Terraform Provider](https://github.com/stackitcloud/terraform-provider-stackit) and the [STACKIT CLI](https://github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-cli), there is the need to implement waiters for some SDK modules. Waiters are routines that wait for the completion of asynchronous operations. They are located in a folder named `wait` inside each service folder.

Let's suppose you want to implement the waiters for the `Create`, `Update` and `Delete` operations of a resource `bar` of service `foo`:

1. Start by creating a new folder `wait/` inside `services/foo/`, if it doesn't exist yet
2. Create a file `wait.go` inside your new folder `services/foo/wait`, if it doesn't exist yet. The Go package should be named `wait`.
3. Refer to the [Waiter structure](./CONTRIBUTION.md/#waiter-structure) section for details on the structure of the file and the methods
4. Add unit tests to the wait functions

#### Waiter structure

Below is a typical structure of a waiter for an SDK module:

```go
package wait

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-sdk-go/core/wait"
	"github.com/stackitcloud/stackit-sdk-go/services/foo"
)

const (
	CreateSuccess = "CREATE_SUCCEEDED"
	CreateFail    = "CREATE_FAILED"
	UpdateSuccess = "UPDATE_SUCCEEDED"
	UpdateFail    = "UPDATE_FAILED"
	DeleteSuccess = "DELETE_SUCCEEDED"
	DeleteFail    = "DELETE_FAILED"
)

// APIClientInterface Interfaces needed for tests
type APIClientInterface interface {
	GetBarExecute(ctx context.Context, BarId, projectId string) (*foo.GetBarResponse, error)
}

// CreateBarWaitHandler will wait for Bar creation
func CreateBarWaitHandler(ctx context.Context, a APIClientInterface, BarId, projectId string) *wait.AsyncActionHandler[foo.GetBarResponse] {
	handler := wait.New(func() (waitFinished bool, response *foo.GetBarResponse, err error) {
		s, err := a.GetBarExecute(ctx, BarId, projectId)
		if err != nil {
			return false, nil, err
		}
		if s.Id == nil || s.Status == nil {
			return false, nil, fmt.Errorf("could not get Bar id or status from response for project %s and Bar %s", projectId, BarId)
		}
		if *s.Id == BarId && *s.Status == CreateSuccess {
			return true, s, nil
		}
		if *s.Id == BarId && *s.Status == CreateFail {
			return true, s, fmt.Errorf("create failed for Bar with id %s", BarId)
		}
		return false, nil, nil
	})
	handler.SetTimeout(45 * time.Minute)
	return handler
}

// UpdateBarWaitHandler will wait for Bar update
func UpdateBarWaitHandler(ctx context.Context, a APIClientInterface, BarId, projectId string) *wait.AsyncActionHandler[foo.GetBarResponse] {
	handler := wait.New(func() (waitFinished bool, response *foo.GetBarResponse, err error) {
		s, err := a.GetBarExecute(ctx, BarId, projectId)
		if err != nil {
			return false, nil, err
		}
		if s.Id == nil || s.Status == nil {
			return false, nil, fmt.Errorf("could not get Bar id or status from response for project %s and Bar %s", projectId, BarId)
		}
		if *s.Id == BarId && (*s.Status == UpdateSuccess) {
			return true, s, nil
		}
		if *s.Id == BarId && (*s.Status == UpdateFail) {
			return true, s, fmt.Errorf("update failed for Bar with id %s", BarId)
		}
		return false, nil, nil
	})
	handler.SetTimeout(30 * time.Minute)
	return handler
}

// DeleteBarWaitHandler will wait for Bar deletion
func DeleteBarWaitHandler(ctx context.Context, a APIClientInterface, BarId, projectId string) *wait.AsyncActionHandler[foo.GetBarResponse] {
	handler := wait.New(func() (waitFinished bool, response *foo.GetBarResponse, err error) {
		s, err := a.GetBarExecute(ctx, BarId, projectId)
		if err != nil {
			return false, nil, err
		}
		if s.Id == nil || s.Status == nil {
			return false, nil, fmt.Errorf("could not get Bar id or status from response for project %s and Bar %s", projectId, BarId)
		}
		if *s.Id == BarId && *s.Status == DeleteSuccess {
			return true, s, nil
		}
		if *s.Id == BarId && *s.Status == DeleteFail {
			return true, s, fmt.Errorf("delete failed for Bar with id %s", BarId)
		}
		return false, nil, nil
	})
	handler.SetTimeout(20 * time.Minute)
	return handler
}
```

#### Notes

- The success condition may vary from service to service. In the example above we wait for the field `Status` to match a successful or failed message, but other services may have different fields and/or values to represent the state of the create, update or delete operations
- The `id` and the `state` might not be present on the root level of the API response, this also varies from service to service. You must always match the resource `id` and the resource `state` to what is expected
- The timeout values included above are just for reference, each resource takes different amounts of time to finish the create, update or delete operations. You should account for some buffer, e.g. 15 minutes, on top of normal execution times
- For some resources, after a successful delete operation the resource can't be found anymore, so a call to the `Get` method would result in an error. In those cases, the waiter can be implemented by calling the `List` method and check that the resource is not present, like in this example:

  ```go
  // DeleteBarWaitHandler will wait for Bar deletion
  func DeleteBarWaitHandler(ctx context.Context, a APIClientInterface, barId, projectId string) *wait.AsyncActionHandler[foo.ListBarsResponse] {
      handler := wait.New(func() (waitFinished bool, response *foo.ListBarsResponse, err error) {
          s, err := a.ListBarsExecute(ctx, barId, projectId)
          if err != nil {
              return false, nil, err
          }
          for i := range s {
              if *s[i].Id == barId {
                  return false, nil, nil
              }
          }
          return true, s, nil
      })
      handler.SetTimeout(10 * time.Minute)
      return handler
  }
  ```

- The main objective of the waiter functions is to make sure that the operation was successful, which means any other special cases such as intermediate error states should also be handled
