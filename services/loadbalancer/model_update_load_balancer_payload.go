/*
Load Balancer API

This API offers an interface to provision and manage load balancing servers in your STACKIT project. It also has the possibility of pooling target servers for load balancing purposes.  For each load balancer provided, two VMs are deployed in your OpenStack project subject to a fee.

	// Load balancer resource version. Must be empty or unset for creating load balancers, non-empty for updating load balancers. Semantics: While retrieving load balancers, this is the current version of this load balancer resource that changes during updates of the load balancers. On updates this field specified the load balancer version you calculated your update for instead of the future version to enable concurrency safe updates. Update calls will then report the new version in their result as you would see with a load balancer retrieval call later. There exist no total order of the version, so you can only compare it for equality, but not for less/greater than another version. Since the creation of load balancer is always intended to create the first version of it, there should be no existing version. That's why this field must by empty of not present in that case.
	Version *string `json:"version,omitempty"`
